This folder contains a project that controls a vehicle's yaw rate for stabilization and path following. Written by Brian Lesko

Limitations:
By using a linearized bicycle model, the model is for constant vehicle speed and valid for smaller lateral accelerations.

Uses: 
The script and associated Simulink model is good for modelling lane changes and parallel parking.
