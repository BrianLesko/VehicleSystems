This folder contains a controls project for a linearized dynamics vehicle model. Written by Brian Lesko
This method achieves path following by using the state space model block in simulink and using the associated equations of motion for the vehicle.

The model is useful for constant speed and low accelerations. Controlled output is based off path following error
