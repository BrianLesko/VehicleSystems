This folder contains projects related to path following models that take vehicle dynamics into account. By Brian Lesko

12/19/22 Project added using a linearized bicycle model with the goal of passing the Ohio Driverse Licence manueverability test. 
12/20/22 Project added using yaw rate control for path following, also using the linearized bicycle model. Controls applicable to lane change and   parallel parking. Lacking robust capabilities for road friction and vehicle speed. Further investigation is needed
